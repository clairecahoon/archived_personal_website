                            I am in the process of designing a web-based teaching module that will provide self-guided instruction to incoming graduate students. The school offers an exam to test out of a class that covers information technology topics, including basic file management, web development, and database skills. I am working with a fellow graduate student to develop an accessible, inclusive, and informative study guide for the test so that students feel empowered to teach themselves the skills and pass the test before starting their masterâ€™s program.

                            UNC's Libraries facilitate communities of practice to help create communities to discuss prominent library topics and help connect groups of people working on similar projects. I started the Digital Pedagogy Community of Practice in conjunction with Sarah Morris, and now run the communications, advertising, and choose topics for the discussion. Meeting once every month, the communities of practice are intended to be flat and not have any recognized leadership, so I do not lead discussions or make overarching decisions for the group. Instead, Sarah Morris and I help to create the space and materials for discussion so that the group can talk about issues surrounding teaching with and about technology. Topics have included project charters, creating learning objectives, and reflections on positive and negative technology experiences, among others.

                            UNC Chapel Hill requires each first-year student to take an introductory research and writing course (ENGL 105) which often includes a library information session. At the instructor's request, librarians and library students come into classes and teach one or more sessions on library resources, research strategies, and workshop topics or keywords with students. I teach and co-teach these sessions, tailoring each lesson to fit the assignments and needs of the professor and incorporating active learning techniques. This includes attending a pedagogy discussion group that focuses on teaching skills with digital tools and structuring learning goals within the ACRL framework.

The workshop series offers classes to community members on basic computer skills. Class topics include basic computer skills, email, word, excel, health literacy, social media use, and more. I volunteered as a "floater" in these classes several times over each semester, providing assistance to the leader of the session and giving one-on-one help to students who needed it. The classes I have helped with a variety of classes, including  "<a href="https://ils.unc.edu/cws/Handouts/Email/Email%20Basics%20%7c%20Gmail/Email-Basics-Gmail.pdf">Email Basics</a>" and "<a href="https://ils.unc.edu/cws/Handouts/Microsoft%20Office/Excel%20Basics/2013/Excel-Basics-2013.pdf">Microsoft Excel Basics</a>" at the Carrboro Cybrary and the Chapel Hill Public Library.

I instructed patrons how to use the <a href="https://library.unc.edu/">library website</a> and library resources as well as find ready-reference answers and provide links to articles and resources.

The project explores the difference in dialogue between artificial intelligence characters and human characters in science fiction short stories from the 20th century.

                            I was a Library of Congress Junior Fellow in the summer of 2017. I worked within the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov">U.S. Copyright Office</a> in the Office of Public Information and Education with <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/about/leadership/george-thuronyi.html">George Thuronyi</a> sorting and organizing archival material for a public display. I worked through over 2000 artifacts from the Copyright archives from the late 19th and early 20th century and assessed each one for historical value and potential inclusion in a public display about the Copyright Office. At the end of the summer, I submitted my findings and the metadata for each artifact to be used for the eventual display and wrote a blog post: <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/copyright/2017/07/copyright-creativity-then-and-now/">"Copyright Creativity, Then and Now"</a>. I also presented my work in a Junior Fellows showcase, which included several interesting board game and gaming objects that had been submitted for copyright in the early 20th century. 
                            <br>Throughout my time at the Library of Congress, I attended events, lectures, tours, training sessions, classes, and spoke with current librarians in order to gain as much knowledge as I could about the workings of the Library of Congress and its library staff.

                                I have taken "Introduction to Database Concepts and Applications" and "Database Systems II: Intermediate Databases" at the graduate level at UNC Chapel Hill, which covers SQL database design and implementation through mySQL. I have worked with ER diagraming, relational database design, relational algebra, and normalization. I have also worked with databases on the backend of website in the course "Advanced Web" at the undergraduate level at Ithaca College, which covered using SQL through the command line and integration into PHP webpages to access stored information.<br>
