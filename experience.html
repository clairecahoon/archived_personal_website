                            Incoming master’s students in the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill School of Information and Library Science have the opportunity to take a three-part online test to complete their Information Technology Competency Requirement. While the test encourages students to teach themselves the skills, use outside resources, and continue to resubmit until they pass the exam, there are few updated resources available to assist with the process. This project created an online learning module that provides students with self-guided lessons and external resources in order to help them learn the skills necessary to pass the test. The overarching goal of the project was to lower the barrier of entry for incoming master’s students to teach themselves technology skills and improve their digital literacy. <a href="infotechstudyguide.web.unc.edu">See the study guide here.</a>

                            <strong>October 2018 - May 2020</strong><br>
                            UNC’s Libraries facilitate communities of practice to help create library communities discuss prominent topics and connect groups of people working on similar projects. I started the Digital Pedagogy Community of Practice with Sarah Morris at the beginning of the fall 2018 semester, and now run communications, facilitate advertising, and choose topics for the discussion. Meeting once every month, the community of practice is creates the space and materials for discussion so that the group can talk about issues surrounding teaching with and about technology. Here is a list of our previous topics:
                            <ul>   
                            <li>Using project charters</li>
                                <li>Creating learning objectives for digital projects
                                <li>Digital copyright basics
                                <li>Campus collaborations (with the BeAM Makerspaces and Ackland Art Museum)
                                <li>Sharing current projects
                                <li>Exploratory learning in tool-based lessons
                                <li>Cross training and co-consultations
                                <li>Critiquing workshop lessons
                                <li>Mapping digital pedagogy to the new UNC-Chapel Hill curriculum
                                <li>Teaching reliability in digital media
                                <li>Remote instruction
                            </ul>
This group has been an important part of staying on the pulse of the digital pedagogy community in the Libraries, and I have learned a lot about instructing with technology from the members. It has also been a valuable way to seek out new sources of literature in our field, specifically those concerning instruction and digital tools (Hybrid Pedagogy has been a favorite).

                            UNC Chapel Hill requires each first-year student to take an introductory research and writing course (ENGL 105) which often includes a library information session. At the instructor's request, librarians and library students come into classes and teach one or more sessions on library resources, research strategies, and workshop topics or keywords with students. I teach and co-teach these sessions, tailoring each lesson to fit the assignments and needs of the professor and incorporating active learning techniques. This includes attending a pedagogy discussion group that focuses on teaching skills with digital tools and structuring learning goals within the ACRL framework.

The workshop series offers classes to community members on basic computer skills. Class topics include basic computer skills, email, word, excel, health literacy, social media use, and more. I volunteered as a "floater" in these classes several times over each semester, providing assistance to the leader of the session and giving one-on-one help to students who needed it. The classes I have helped with a variety of classes, including  "<a href="https://ils.unc.edu/cws/Handouts/Email/Email%20Basics%20%7c%20Gmail/Email-Basics-Gmail.pdf">Email Basics</a>" and "<a href="https://ils.unc.edu/cws/Handouts/Microsoft%20Office/Excel%20Basics/2013/Excel-Basics-2013.pdf">Microsoft Excel Basics</a>" at the Carrboro Cybrary and the Chapel Hill Public Library.

The project explores the difference in dialogue between artificial intelligence characters and human characters in science fiction short stories from the 20th century. I wrote a program in Python that gathers the data about each text's characters (average word length, average sentence length, part of speech usage, common words, and more) that I use to do a literary analysis on each story.

                            I was a Library of Congress Junior Fellow in the summer of 2017. I worked within the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov">U.S. Copyright Office</a> in the Office of Public Information and Education with <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/about/leadership/george-thuronyi.html">George Thuronyi</a> sorting and organizing archival material for a public display. I worked through over 2000 artifacts from the Copyright archives from the late 19th and early 20th century and assessed each one for historical value and potential inclusion in a public display about the Copyright Office. At the end of the summer, I submitted my findings and the metadata for each artifact to be used for the eventual display and wrote a blog post: <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/copyright/2017/07/copyright-creativity-then-and-now/">"Copyright Creativity, Then and Now"</a>. I also presented my work in a Junior Fellows showcase, which included several interesting board game and gaming objects that had been submitted for copyright in the early 20th century. 
                            <br>Throughout my time at the Library of Congress, I attended events, lectures, tours, training sessions, classes, and spoke with current librarians in order to gain as much knowledge as I could about the workings of the Library of Congress and its library staff.

                                I have taken "Introduction to Database Concepts and Applications" and "Database Systems II: Intermediate Databases" at the graduate level at UNC Chapel Hill, which covers SQL database design and implementation through mySQL. I have worked with ER diagraming, relational database design, relational algebra, and normalization. I have also worked with databases on the backend of website in the course "Advanced Web" at the undergraduate level at Ithaca College, which covered using SQL through the command line and integration into PHP webpages to access stored information.<br>
