                            UNC's Libraries facilitate communities of practice to help create communities to discuss prominent library topics and help connect groups of people working on similar projects. I started the Digital Pedagogy Community of Practice in conjunction with Sarah Morris, and now run the communications, advertising, and choose topics for the discussion. Meeting once every month, the communities of practice are intended to be flat and not have any recognized leadership, so I do not lead discussions or make overarching decisions for the group. Instead, Sarah Morris and I help to create the space and materials for discussion so that the group can talk about issues surrounding teaching with and about technology. Topics have included project charters, creating learning objectives, and reflections on positive and negative technology experiences, among others.

                            UNC Chapel Hill requires each first-year student to take an introductory research and writing course (ENGL 105) which often includes a library information session. At the instructor's request, librarians and library students come into classes and teach one or more sessions on library resources, research strategies, and workshop topics or keywords with students. I teach and co-teach these sessions, tailoring each lesson to fit the assignments and needs of the professor and incorporating active learning techniques. This includes attending a pedagogy discussion group that focuses on teaching skills with digital tools and structuring learning goals within the ACRL framework.

I am helping with creating, maintaining, and facilitating student projects with Scalar.

The project explores the difference in dialogue between artificial intelligence characters and human characters in science fiction short stories from the 20th century. I wrote a program in Python that gathers the data about each text's characters (average word length, average sentence length, part of speech usage, common words, and more) that I use to do a literary analysis on each story.

                            I was a Library of Congress Junior Fellow in the summer of 2017. I worked within the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov">U.S. Copyright Office</a> in the Office of Public Information and Education with <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/about/leadership/george-thuronyi.html">George Thuronyi</a> sorting and organizing archival material for a public display. I worked through over 2000 artifacts from the Copyright archives from the late 19th and early 20th century and assessed each one for historical value and potential inclusion in a public display about the Copyright Office. At the end of the summer, I submitted my findings and the metadata for each artifact to be used for the eventual display and wrote a blog post: <a href="https://blogs.loc.gov/copyright/2017/07/copyright-creativity-then-and-now/">"Copyright Creativity, Then and Now"</a>. I also presented my work in a Junior Fellows showcase, which included several interesting board game and gaming objects that had been submitted for copyright in the early 20th century. 
                            <br>Throughout my time at the Library of Congress, I attended events, lectures, tours, training sessions, classes, and spoke with current librarians in order to gain as much knowledge as I could about the workings of the Library of Congress and its library staff.
